			<h2>Pettie COMMUNITY</h2>
			<p>Pettie community is a platform for those who can no longer take care of their pets, and to those who needs a pet. Owners will get face to face interactions with each other and have a smooth transaction between cat owners. It’s will be easy for people who wants a pet, where all the vaccines and materials are already taken cared of. It will also be convenience for people who need to travel or move locations and any other reason that they can’t take care of their animals anymore. So they do not have to sent them to pet shelters.

						<p>Cats are so cute, aren’t they? But around 27% of cats are acquired as strays by APPA. They don’t have family, and image one day, they may die from diseases, or cold, or hunger. Let’s take action now to save their life and give them home! They need you! </p>

						<p>Dogs are our best friends! According to the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP), just less than 2% cats and 15 to 20% of dogs are safely returned to their owners. They need you! They want homes! They love the world! Let’s give them a sweet house!</p>
